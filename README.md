#### Run Consumet API locally (optional) ####

If you want to run the Consumet API locally (for development or to use a local API endpoint), you can clone and start the Consumet API server:

```bash
# Clone the Consumet API repository
git clone https://github.com/consumet/api.consumet.org.git

# Change into the repository directory
cd api.consumet.org

# Install dependencies (npm or yarn)
npm install    # or yarn install

# Start the server
npm start      # or yarn start
```

This will run the Consumet API server locally. Configure your application to use the local server address as needed.
